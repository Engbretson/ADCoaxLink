The last supported version of the software for RHEL 7 x64 appears to 6.2. As of today the current released versions for windows and 32-bit Centos ??? is 9.3. Some of these versions have introduced non backwards/forward compatible source code changes. So this branch, nominally 6.1 will up upgraded to 6.2 and will be the 'live' branch while the current master branch have most probably have a few version 7, 8, and 9 commits to deal with those specific driver version changes, but will not be actively maintained.
